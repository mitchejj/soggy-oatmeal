Here it is nearly mid May and I have exactly kept my promise to myself to post more. I have start writing a few items that just haven't been published as I'm still working on defining that workflow that works best for me. I still don't have any process or flow going with the iPad Pro full time.

Here is getting trying to make that change. I think I have a few new/better ideas to make the workflow work for me. First, I think I will work to using Drafts as my defualt workspace for writting up new post. Second I think I will work towards using the github webinterace to copy/paste daftwork as I progress. It might work, it might not, here is to giving it a go.
