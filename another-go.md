I did it again. I'm moving my site generation to Hugo.

I am still thinking through the entire layout and workflow for the site. I'm mostly trying to keep everything sane by using a stock theme with minimual modifications. As a result older content might be a little off; the content has been logically split, the 'Archives' have two distinct sections [/backlog](/backlog/) and the newer [/weblog](/weblog/).
